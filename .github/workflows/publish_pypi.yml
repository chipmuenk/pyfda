# Workflow for building a pip package and uploading it to PyPI
# see https://data-dive.com/multi-os-deployment-in-cloud-using-pyinstaller-and-github-actions
#
# OpenID connect (OIDC) provides short-lived credentials ("OIDC tokens")
# for upload to PyPI, see https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/
#
# The workflow runs:
#  - when manually triggered
#  - for tagged release events, creating a versioned release
#
#    The latter requires a workflow like
#
#    * <update version.py>      # PyPI version number is created from this
#    * <merge develop and main, push develop (default branch)
#    * git tag v0.4.5           # create new local tag
#    * git push origin tag v0.4.5  # push only tag to origin
#    * checkout main
#    * git push                 # push changes to origin, sending a 'push main' event
#    * <draft a (pre)release on Github from tag,
#       sending a 'release' event>
#
#   Tags can be deleted with:
#
#     git tag -d <tag_name>
#     git push --delete origin <tag_name>
