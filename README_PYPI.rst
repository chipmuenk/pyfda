pyFDA - Python Filter Design Analysis Tool
==========================================

pyFDA is a GUI based tool in Python / Qt for analysing and designing discrete time filters. 

When the `migen<https://github.com/m-labs/migen>`_ module is installed, 
fixpoint simulations and Verilog export can be performed for some filter types.

Due to increasing problems with PyPIs RST / MD (non-)rendering, find all other infos at 
`GitHub<https://github.com/chipmuenk/pyFDA/>`_ and `ReadTheDocs<https://pyfda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
