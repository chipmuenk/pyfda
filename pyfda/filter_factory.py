        Create an instance of the filter design class passed as a string ``fc``
        from the module found in ``fb.filter_classes[fc]``.
        This dictionary has been collected by ``tree_builder.py``.

        The instance can afterwards be globally referenced as ``fil_inst``.


        Parameters
        ----------

        fc : str
            The name of the filter design class to be instantiated (e.g. 'cheby1' or 'equiripple')

        mod : str (optional, default = None)
            Fully qualified name of the filter module. When not specified, it is
            read from the global dict ``fb.filter_classes[fc]['mod']``

        Returns
        -------

        err_code : int
          one of the following error codes:

            :0: filter instance exists, no re-instantiation necessary

            :1: filter module not found by FilterTreeBuilder
